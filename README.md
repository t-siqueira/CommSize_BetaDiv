# CommSize_BetaDiv
This is a repo for the codes I used in my community size - beta diversity relationship paper.

Here is some information about the data.

Data can be download here: https://zenodo.org/record/2542271

These data files are needed to run the R code and reproduce the results I show in the paper.

bio_20_bra.csv: a matrix with the abundance of each genus (columns) sampled in each stream (rows) in Brazil. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.

bio_20_fin.csv: a matrix with the abundance of each genus (columns) sampled in each stream (rows) in Finland. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively.

bio_20_bra_mod.csv: a matrix with the abundance of each genus (columns) sampled in each stream (rows) in Brazil. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded from 1 to 5 within each watershed (replicates). This was necessary due to a step in the R code that estimates abundance based beta deviation.

bio_20_fin.csv: a matrix with the abundance of each genus (columns) sampled in each stream (rows) in Finland. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded from 1 to 5 within each watershed (replicates). This was necessary due to a step in the R code that estimates abundance based beta deviation.

env_20_bra.csv: a matrix with the values of each in-stream variable (as described above) estimated in each stream (rows) in Brazil. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.

env_20_fin.csv: a matrix with the values of each in-stream variable (as described above) estimated in each stream (rows) in Finland. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.

land_20_bra.csv: a matrix with the values of each catchment level variable (as described above) estimated around each stream (rows) in Brazil. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.

land_20_fin.csv: a matrix with the values of each catchment level variable (as described above) estimated around each stream (rows) in Finland. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.

spa_20_bra.csv: geographical coordinates (decimal degrees) of each stream (rows) in Brazil. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.

spa_20_fin.csv: geographical coordinates (decimal degrees) of each stream (rows) in Finland. The first and second columns represent streams and watersheds identity respectively. Stream identify is coded sequentially.
